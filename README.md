# grunt-public-js

> Automated tasks for [public.js](https://github.com/alex-seville/public.js)

## Getting Started
This plugin requires Grunt `~0.4.1`

If you haven't used [Grunt](http://gruntjs.com/) before, be sure to check out the [Getting Started](http://gruntjs.com/getting-started) guide, as it explains how to create a [Gruntfile](http://gruntjs.com/sample-gruntfile) as well as install and use Grunt plugins. Once you're familiar with that process, you may install this plugin with this command:


## The "public-js" task

The public.js task operates in 2 modes: scaffold and lint.

###scaffold

Scaffold mode will take a public.js parse tree and apply it against a template.  This is useful for generating unit test scaffolding, or documentation.

###lint

The lint mode takes a public.js parse tree and scans it for accessor errors, and unexpected or missing export objects.


## Contributing
In lieu of a formal styleguide, take care to maintain the existing coding style. Add unit tests for any new or changed functionality. Lint and test your code using [Grunt](http://gruntjs.com/).


## Release History
BETA release.  Please help this project become more stable.
